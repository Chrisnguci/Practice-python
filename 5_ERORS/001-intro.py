# How to deal with Eror?
1. Look at your code
2. Put the error and message into GG, see if something comes up with Stackoverflow
3. Look at the code , this time more slowly, and run through it as if you were a computer. Notice if anything that could potentially be a source of the error
4. Run only someparts of the code in isolation, that'll help identify which part of your code is giving you an error
5. Use a debugger
